	<h1>Journal Entries</h1>
	<h2>Journal Entry #1</h2>

<p> this week I learned about how a random student was able to build and use his own paraglider.

<h2>Journal Entry #2</h2>
<p>
	This week has been great. I learned a lot in all my classes, I've been able to get more sleep, and its overall been a great time. I am excited to start October.

</p>

<h2>Journal Entry #3</h2>
<p>
	I think that my animation code works by changing the position by a certain amount of pixels while fading different colors. The timing of the events are controlled by the percentage of animation duration
</p>



<h2>Journal Entry #4</h2>
<p>
	For my codesketch homework, I made a birthday card for William by adding the audio file for our favorite hockey team, the Montreal Canadiens, goal horn. Then, a count is created for every time the user clicks the screen. I created an 'if' statement to play and pause the audio file depending on if the amount of clicks is odd or even, changing it from play to pause every click. William being born in London, I also added a picture of what William would look like as a baby in the middle. It dissapears and reappears using the same 'if' statement, and changing the background image from nothing to the picture and back again.
</p>
<h2>Journal Entry #5</h2>
<p>
	My square quilt works by first making a function to create a bunch of squares even distance apart that all look the same. Then to make this make a bunch of squares, there is a loop to continuosly make as many squares as I want. By using the "i" variable created with the loop, I can use this to set different background images to be set for each square. This works because the "i" variable changes with every loop, so I used this to change the background image assigned to each square. I then also added a click counter to pause a play the Canadiens goal horn.
</p>
<h2>Journal Entry #6</h2>
<p>
	My rgb array project works by first creating the box, styling it, and placing the header, "Click to get your new random color". Then, in javascript I created a function that when you click the box, would create 3 random numbers in variables from 0 to 1, multiply them by 255, the max color value, and then round them to the nearest number. Then, with these three random numbers, I set the background color of my box to with the red rgb value being the first random, blue being the second, and 3 being the third. This gives you a completely random color everytime you click. 

</p>
<h2>Journal Entry #7</h2>
<p>
	I made a valentines day card for my mom. It features many of her favorite things, like chicago, her mediation and casa, work, and taylor swift. It uses an event listener to cycle through the different images and a click counter to pause and play the song. I had diffuculty figuring out how to make the images on the left and right cycle back and forth, but eventually, I figured it out.
</p>
<h2>Journal Entry #8</h2>
<p>
	My Car project works by first creating a div to represent the car, and making its position absolute. Then, I created a variable to represent the distance from the left and from the top for the cars position. After that, I created a function that would add or subtract 10 from either the top or left value. This depends on which key was pressed, the up, down, left, or right arrow key. This creates the car moving. I also created some extra divs to represent obstacles and a finish line so there is a little race track.
