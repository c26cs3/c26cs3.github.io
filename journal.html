	<h1>Journal Entries</h1>
	<h2>Journal Entry #1</h2>

<p> this week I learned about how a random student was able to build and use his own paraglider.

<h2>Journal Entry #2</h2>
<p>
	This week has been great. I learned a lot in all my classes, I've been able to get more sleep, and its overall been a great time. I am excited to start October.

</p>

<h2>Journal Entry #3</h2>
<p>
	I think that my animation code works by changing the position by a certain amount of pixels while fading different colors. The timing of the events are controlled by the percentage of animation duration
</p>



<h2>Journal Entry #4</h2>
<p>
	For my codesketch homework, I made a birthday card for William by adding the audio file for our favorite hockey team, the Montreal Canadiens, goal horn. Then, a count is created for every time the user clicks the screen. I created an 'if' statement to play and pause the audio file depending on if the amount of clicks is odd or even, changing it from play to pause every click. William being born in London, I also added a picture of what William would look like as a baby in the middle. It dissapears and reappears using the same 'if' statement, and changing the background image from nothing to the picture and back again.
